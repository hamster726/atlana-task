# ATLANA task

❗❗❗ **BEFORE STARTING APP ADD YOUR GITHUB USER TOKEN** ❗❗❗

src/api/api-github.ts => const access_token = ""

### React Test Task


Please build a web application that is able to search through GitHub users and their corresponding projects using the GitHub api: https://docs.github.com/en/rest using React. The application shall contain 2 screens.

The first screen will contain a search bar that can search through any user on the GitHub website at the top with a list of results underneath.  Each item should contain the avatar image, username, and the number of repositories they have.  The list view shall not be paginated.  Additionally, the search will automatically update upon each letter entered.

Tapping on a user will bring up a screen that contains the profile details of that user.  The view should contain their avatar image, username, number of followers, number of following, biography, email, location, join date, and a list of public repositories with a search bar at the top. Each item of the list view shall contain the name of the repository, the number of stars, and the Number of forks. The search bar will allow the user to search through the user’s repository. The list view shall not be paginated. Additionally, the search will automatically update upon each letter entered.

Tapping on a repository shall bring the user to a web browser and open the repository in the GitHub website.

You shall be given 24 hours to complete this task.

The application will be used during the interview, please be ready to explain and defend your choices for technologies and coding paradigms.

Nice to have - All results should be cached such that when going back, the results should still be displayed on the previous screen.

The application shall be hosted on your own GitHub.

**Also make sure that the application completely works before submitting it.**

Preferable technology - **TypeScript**

**Bonus Points:**

- Please add something that seems “cool feature” for you. It could be CSS animation, Typescript code snippet, color theme - anything you want. Main requirement - realization time should not exceed 1 hour.
